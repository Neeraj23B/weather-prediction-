The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end weather prediction system that leverages data from various sources, including web scraping from weather websites and APIs, data preprocessing, building a classification model, making accurate weather predictions, and visualizing the results.

## Overview
This project aims to develop an end-to-end weather prediction system utilizing data from various sources, including web scraping from weather websites and APIs. The system encompasses data preprocessing, building classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Gaussian NB), accurate weather predictions, and result visualization. The ultimate goal is to provide users with reliable and localized weather forecasts.

### SVM Model (5.1)
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model is implemented for classifying data into two or more classes. SVMs find the hyperplane that best separates data points while maximizing the margin between classes. The advantages include handling high-dimensional feature spaces and transforming optimization problems into dual convex quadratic programs.

### Logistic Regression (5.2)
Logistic regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm, is utilized for predicting the probability of an instance belonging to a given class. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression employs a sigmoid function to estimate class probabilities.

### Gaussian NB (5.3)
Gaussian Naïve Bayes, an extension of Naïve Bayes, is based on the Bayes theorem. It simplifies implementation by using a Gaussian (normal) distribution, requiring the calculation of mean and standard deviation for training data.

## Machine Learning (3)
### Independent and Dependent Variables (3.1)
Explains the concept of independent and dependent variables in scientific research, particularly their role in cause-and-effect relationships. In experimental research, the independent variable is manipulated to observe its effect on the dependent variable.

### Training and Testing (3.2)
Describes the common practice of training machine learning models on a dataset and evaluating their performance on a testing dataset. Various datasets are used during the creation of the model, and supervised learning methods are employed.

### Data Description (3.3)
Explores exploratory data analysis (EDA) in statistics, emphasizing the importance of analyzing data sets to understand their main characteristics. EDA involves statistical graphics and visualization methods.

### Score Prediction (3.4)
Discusses predictive modeling, which utilizes statistics to predict outcomes, often focused on future events. Examples include crime detection, spam identification in emails, and the use of classifiers.

### Model Evaluation (3.5)
Highlights the significance of model evaluation in machine learning. While training is crucial, the generalization of the model on unseen data is equally important. The section emphasizes the need to assess a model's ability to make accurate predictions on new samples.
